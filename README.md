### Hi there, I'm [Dushyant!](https://dushyantrathore.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dushyantRathore/dushyantRathore** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a full stack developer experienced in Web Development, Machine and Deep Learning, Algorithms, GUI Development, Chatbots, Amazon Web Services, Cloud Computing, and Web Scraping.

I have development experience using programming languages like C/C++, Python, NodeJS and PHP. I am also an active researcher with publications in top international conferences in the field of Evolutionary Computation, Deep Neural Networks and Natural Language Processing.

*NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages i have the most code on github, it's a new feature of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)*
